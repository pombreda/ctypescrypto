This library is a pure python cryptographic library for OpenSSL

It provides:
  1. Hashing Algorithms: MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512
  1. Secret Key Encryption: DES, DES-EDE3, BF, AES-128, AES-192, AES-256
  1. Confidentiality Modes: CBC, CFB, OFB, ECB
  1. OpenSSL Pseudo Random number generation.

Future work would include
  1. Public Key Encryption: RSA (encrypt/decrypt, sign/verify)
  1. Certificates: X.509 Certificate parsing and validation
  1. Protocols: (TLS and SSL)
